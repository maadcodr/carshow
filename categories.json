In the U.S., production resumed in 1946, and the post-war boom resulted in more cars available for everyone.  Innovations of the time include power windows, the ignition key, and turn signals (still not used by many drivers today). Vote for the car that best represents “The Greatest Generation.”",

The Big 3 American manufacturers responded with pony and muscle cars like the Mustang and Camaro, along with more luxurious offerings from the likes of Cadillac and Lincoln.  America probably changed more during this decade than any other—and so did the cars, so selecting the best example will be challenging.
